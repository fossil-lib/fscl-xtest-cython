## Setting up, Compiling, Installing, and Running the Project

**Adding Dependency**:

Create a directory named subprojects in the root directory, next create a file named `fscl-xtest-cython.wrap` in the `subprojects` directory of your project with the following content:

   ```ini
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossil-lib/fscl-xtest-cython.git
   revision = main
   
   [provide]
   fscl-xtest-cython = fscl_xtest_cython_dep
   ```

**Integrate Dependency**:
   ```meson
   project('my_project', 'cython')

   exe = executable('my_project', 'my_project.pyx',
       dependencies : dependency('fscl-xtest-cython')) # add this line

   test('basic', exe)
   ```

## Including the Demo and Running Tests

To run tests, you can use the following options when configuring the build:

- **Running Tests**: Add `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:
